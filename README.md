# 🧠 Solidity Mastery Blueprint

Welcome to my personal roadmap to mastering **Solidity** and becoming a high-value **Web3 engineer**. This repo is my journal, blueprint, and portfolio-in-progress — built from scratch with determination, curiosity, and the desire to create a better future with blockchain technology.

---

## 🎯 Mission

To master Solidity development, smart contract security, and full-stack dApp development — enabling me to build impactful Web3 applications like my **SocialFi dapp** and qualify for high-paying roles as an entry-level **Solidity/Web3 engineer**.

🧩 What I’m Learning
 • ✅ Solidity syntax, types, storage, memory
 • ✅ Inheritance, interfaces, modifiers
 • ✅ Fallback functions, receive, payable
 • ✅ Events & logging
 • ✅ Contract deployment & gas optimization
 • ✅ Foundry testing with forge test
 • ✅ Mocking oracles & forking with Foundry
 • 🔄 Upgradeable contracts & proxies
 • 🔐 Smart contract security (audit mindset)
 • ⛓️ Chainlink data feeds, VRF, Keepers
 • 🧱 Building reusable dApp components
 • 🚀 Preparing for job interviews & real-world dApp dev

🧪 Example Projects
 • ✅ Counter (basic testing)
 • ✅ FundMe (Chainlink price feeds + forks)
 • ✅ Token: ERC20, Capped, Burnable, Miner Rewards
 • ⏳ Multi-user Crowdfunding dApp
 • 🚧 SocialFi Token Network (in progress)
 • 📡 Mock price feeds & contract forking

🧭 Long-Term Goals
 • Contribute to real Web3 projects
 • Build community tools for underrepresented devs
 • Launch the SocialFi app with token utility
 • Earn $100k+ in my first Web3 role
 • Build my GitHub, Warpcast, and X presence
 • Help others in my shoes succeed in Web3

🕐 6+ hours/day:
- 🧩 2h Learning (videos, docs)
- 🔨 2h Practicing (Foundry, Solidity)
- 🧪 1h Testing & debugging
- 📓 1h Writing / logging / sharing
